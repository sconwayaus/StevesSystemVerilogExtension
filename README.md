# Verible Language Server Extension

## Features
The language server provides a couple of features from the [Verible SystemVerilog productivity suite](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible) right in the editor.

 * **Linting**: Checks your code against a number of
   [lint rules](https://chipsalliance.github.io/verible/lint.html) and provides
   'wiggly lines' with diagnostic output and even offers auto-fixes when available.
 * **Formatting**: Offers Format Document/Selection according to the Verible
   formatting style. The 'look' can be configured if needed.
 * **Outline**: Shows the high-level structure of your modules and functions in the
   outline tree. Labelled begin/end blocks are also included.
 * **Hover**: Highlight symbols related to the one under the cursor.
 * **Go-To-Definition**: Jump to the definition of the symbol under the cursor.
 * **Go-To-References**: Jump to the references of the symbol under the cursor.
 * **AUTO**-expansion: Features known from [Emacs
   Verilog-mode](https://www.veripool.org/verilog-mode/), used for expanding
   various `/*AUTO...*/` pragmas in Verilog and SystemVerilog code. These
   expansions are available as code actions.
   * `AUTOARG` – generates a list of non-ANSI ports in a module header,
   * **[&#x1F389; New]** `AUTOINST` with `AUTO_TEMPLATE` – generates connections
     in a module instance based on the instantiated module's ports,
   * **[&#x1F389; New]** `AUTOINPUT`, `AUTOOUTPUT`, `AUTOINOUT` – declares ports
     based on connections generated by `AUTOINST`,
   * **[&#x1F389; New]** `AUTOWIRE` – declares wires based on connections
     generated by `AUTOINST`,
   * **[&#x1F389; New]** `AUTOREG` – declares regs for outputs not connected to
     any module instance.

## Prerequisite on your machine

The Verible plug-in needs the `verible-verilog-ls` executable installed
on your machine.

On Linux and Windows, the plug-in will try to download the necessary
executable (if it's not already available).

Alternatively, [build Verible from source](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible#build).
